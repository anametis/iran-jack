Project Name
Iran Jack test project with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS(+ shadcnUI).

Overview
This project was developed as part of a company test. Based on the information from my first interview, I chose to work with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, aligning with the company's technology stack. The application is designed to be responsive and offers a solid user experience across different devices.

Key Features
Framework: Next.js
Language: TypeScript
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive(seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices).

Notes on Implementation
Given the limited time available, the design is around 90% pixel-perfect, with some minor details that may not be perfectly aligned. My focus was on delivering a functional and responsive application within the time constraints. Additionally, the use of the ShadCN UI library, along with the project's manageable size, meant that significant performance enhancements were not necessary.

Final Thoughts
This project demonstrates my ability to quickly adapt to new technology stacks and deliver a functional, responsive web application under time constraints. (While not 100% pixel-perfect)
